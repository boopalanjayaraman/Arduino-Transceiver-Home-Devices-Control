# Arduino-Transceiver-Home-Devices-Control

This sample code demonstrates the following
- Uses a pair of NRF24 transceivers
- One acts as a transmitter and transmits control information
- The other acts as a receiver and executes (activates) relevant actions
- Here the receiver is connected to electrical components (in originally used circuit) through Relay and Relay was activated / deactivated based on the input
